## Description
I've developed an e-commerce platform with comprehensive functionalities to optimize online business operations. The platform features a robust role-based authentication system, ensuring secure access control and user permissions management. Integrated product management capabilities allow for seamless CRUD operations, filtering, sorting, and pagination, simplifying catalog management. The intuitive shopping cart functionality enables users to effortlessly add, remove, and update items, with real-time calculation of totals, taxes, and shipping costs. Orders are seamlessly processed from checkout to completion, with validation and confirmation mechanisms in place. Leveraging the power of TypeScript, Node.js, Sequelize ORM, and Express.js, my platform delivers scalability, security, and performance. My commitment to excellence extends to comprehensive documentation and rigorous testing, ensuring a smooth user experience and hassle-free deployment. Explore the future of e-commerce with my feature-rich platform.
